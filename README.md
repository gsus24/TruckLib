# TruckLib

**TruckLib** is a C# library for the map format of Euro Truck Simulator 2 / American Truck Simulator.
The primary focus is programmatic map creation, but the library also handles various other tasks needed for this purpose, such as reading prefab descriptor files.

The currently supported map format version is **900** (game version **1.48.5/1.49**).

(This project is pretty much a perpetual alpha, so you'll probably run into a few issues sooner or later, and breaking changes will happen on occasion.)

## What's all this then
**TruckLib.ScsMap**:  
The main namespace of the library: classes for working with the map format.

**TruckLib.Sii**:  
Mostly complete de/serializer for SII and .mat files.

**TruckLib.Model**:  
Some code for working with binary model files (.pm\*). Very basic and hasn't been maintained in ages.

Also contains a (binary) .tobj de/serializer.

**TruckLib.HashFs**:  
A reader for HashFS (.scs) files, the asset archive format of the game.

## Minimal example
```csharp
using System.Numerics;
using TruckLib.ScsMap;

var map = new Map("example");
Model.Add(map, new Vector3(10, 0, 10), "dlc_no_471", "brick", "default");
map.Save(@"<ETS2 folder>\mod\user_map\map");
```

## Documentation
It's long overdue, but I've finally started working on cleaning this thing up a bit and writing some proper documentation
for it. You'll find a link to it here soonâ„¢.

## Known issues and limitations
* The library does not calculate the bounding boxes of items, so you'll need to recalculate on load (Map > Recompute map).
* I've yet to figure out how the game calculates the length of roads etc. What I've come up with is
accurate enough to not be too annoying, but you'll notice while editing one of these items that they will slightly
change their path as the game recalculates its length.
* Anything to do with prefabs may or may not break in unexpected ways.
* The prefab object creator doesn't handle terrain points yet. Unless you need prefab terrain, this is also
 fixed by recalculating.
* External map data (which is how the Winter Wonderland map was included in the game) is not yet supported.
