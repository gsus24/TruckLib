# TruckLib

**TruckLib** is an attempt at writing a C# library for working with the map format of 
Euro Truck Simulator 2 / American Truck Simulator. It also handles various other things, but mapping is the primary focus.

The library currently supports map version 880 (game version 1.38 & 1.39 beta).

(It's all still fairly experimental and half-finished, so you'll probably run into some issues sooner or later.)

Proper documentation will follow eventuallyâ„¢. Until then, you can find some sample code in the Samples folder, or you can check out my tool [DlcCheck](https://github.com/sk-zk/DlcCheck) and my weird experimental thing [OsmProto](https://github.com/sk-zk/OsmProto) for some more existing code.

## What's in the box?
**TruckLib.ScsMap**:  
Create or modify maps for ETS2 and ATS.

**TruckLib.Sii**:  
Mostly complete de/serializer for .sii and .mat files.

**TruckLib.Model**:  
Code for working with binary model files (.pm\*). Works well enough to create or modify simple static models,
but that's about it at the moment.

Also contains a (binary) .tobj de/serializer.

**TruckLib.HashFs**:  
A reader for HashFS (.scs) files.

## Known issues and limitations
* The library does not calculate the bounding box of items, so you'll need to recalculate the map (F8) on load.
* Anything to do with prefabs may or may not break in unexpected ways.
* The prefab object creator doesn't handle terrain points yet. Unless you need prefab terrain, this is also
 fixed by recalculating.
