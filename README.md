TruckLib is an attempt at writing a C# library for working with the map format 
of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator.

(It's not "production ready" by any means, so expect plenty of bugs, missing features, sudden API changes, inconsistent naming and other fun features.)

You can find a short usage sample in the Example folder. Proper documentation will follow eventuallyâ„¢.
